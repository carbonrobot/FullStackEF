This is an example project I use for teaching service layer patterns and SOLID principles around Entity Framework, MVC and Web Api.

Some of the concepts within:

- Dependency Injection
- Context per request
- Unit of Work
- Asynchronous data
- Service Layers

- Central logging
- Central error handling
